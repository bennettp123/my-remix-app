# Remix, the details!

My PD today was a bit of a deeper dive into [remix](https://remix.run).

This effort was based on the [grunge stack](https://github.com/remix-run/grunge-stack),
which is a reference stack for deploying to AWS with DynamoDB and Lambda.
Therefore, some of this (eg `arc`) will be specific to the grunge stack,
and not remix itself. I'll try to call these out.

Prior to this PD session, I'd already launched the stack and gotten it
working, but I'd like to do a bit of a dive into how it works, and list the
details here.

I'll also outline the nice bits, and the not-so-nice bits, as I see them.

# Things I read about

## Philosophy

_see https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/pages/philosophy_

### Server/Client model

> You can make your server fast, but you can't control the user's network.
> 
> The only thing you can do is decrease the amount of stuff you send over the
> network. Less JavaScript, less JSON, less CSS. This is easiest when you have
> a server that you can move the logic to, and a framework that favors
> progressive enhancement.

### Web Standards, HTTP, and HTML

> Browsers and HTML got really good in the 20+ years we've been using it.

> We try to keep the Remix API to a minimum, and instead work with web
> standards.

> If the browser has an API for a use case, Remix uses it.

### Progressive Enhancement

Remix has APIs to both read and write data. It uses the `<form>` API, which
means it works with or without client-side javascript. When javascript is
available, it is used to improve transitions.

The goal isn't to make the app work without javascript, it's more about
simplifying the client/server model (or reducing the things that remix
needs to re-implement).

### Don't Over Abstract

> Remix's APIs make it convenient to use the fundamental
> Browser/HTTP/JavaScript, but those technologies are not hidden from you.

## Technical Details

* Remix doesn't build a server, it builds a handler which is passed to a
  server (such as Lambda, Cloudflare Workers, etc)
* It's built on Web Fetch API, allowing it to run in both nodejs and
  non-nodejs environments
* Its compiler, `remix build` produces the HTTP handler, a browser build, and
  an asset manifest. It is based on `esbuild`
* Remix is the View and the Controller, but it leaves the Model up to you.
  Remix Route modules take on both responsibilities. In the grunge stack, the
  Model is built using `arc.tables`.
* You can use Remix as just a server-side framework, with no client-side
  javascript at all


## Deployment

ðŸš€ Deployment is done using github actions! I simply cannot overstate how
awesome this is.

Some manual setup is needed (generate and store secrets), but this is easily
performed using `arc`.

# `arc` and `arc.tables`

ðŸ˜Ž `arc` seems to be both a deployment tool and a framework.

In the grunge stack, it performs the following functions:
* provisions the DynamoDB tables
* provides easy access to the tables from server-side code
* it also deploys some other things (lambdas, api gateways, etc)

Notably, `arc` does NOT do the full infrustructure! The following are omitted:
* DNS records
* CloudFront/CDN &mdash; at least not in the grunge stack (this is probably
  included in other reference stacks)
* TLS certs

However, these can all be done with other IaC tooling such as pulumi, so I
don't really see this as much of a problem.

`arc.tables` is the framework used to access the database.

```ts
import arc from "@architect/functions";

const db = await arc.tables();
const result = await await db.note.get({ pk: userId, sk: `note#${id}` });
```

Nifty!

# Things I played with

## Convert to single-table schema

https://github.com/bennettp123/my-remix-app/pull/5

Originally, the data model consisted of three types, each with its own
dedicated DynamoDB table:
* User
    ```ts
    pk: `email#${string}`
    email: string
    ```
    | pk                     | sk | attributes              |
    |------------------------|----|-------------------------|
    | email#bob@example.com |    | email: bob@example.com |
* Password
    ```ts
    pk: `email#${string}`
    password: bcrypt(string)
    ```
    | pk                    | sk | attributes             |
    |-----------------------|----|------------------------|
    | email#bob@example.com |    | password: 09u32i1u.... |
* Note
    ```ts
    pk: `email#${string}`
    sk: `note#${cuid}`
    title: string
    body: string
    ```
    | pk                    | sk              | attributes                         |
    |-----------------------|-----------------|------------------------------------|
    | email#bob@example.com | note#iuohk... | title: my first note<br/>body: ... |
    |                       | note#ldjad... | title: my 2nd note<br/>body: ...   |

Access was generally just an easy lookup on `pk = :pk` in the relevant table.

I decided to convert this to a single-table schema because 
[_reasons_](https://www.alexdebrie.com/posts/dynamodb-single-table/#the-solution-pre-join-your-data-into-item-collections)
&mdash; though this app doesn't really benefit from a single-table schema. The
main reason was to dive into the existing models and get a better
understanfing of both the reference stack and `arc.tables` itself.

This turned out to be pretty easy: it's non-production &mdash; no need to
worry about data loss ðŸ’€

Also, the schema already included things like `email#` in its keys, so I
didn't to make too many changes to the queries.

Afterwards:

* User
    ```ts
    pk: `email#${string}`
    sk: 'email'
    email: string
    ```
* Password
    ```ts
    pk: `email#${string}`
    sk: 'password'
    password: bcrypt(string)
    ```
* Note
    ```ts
    pk: `email#${string}`
    sk: `note#${cuid}`
    title: string
    body: string
    ```

| pk                    | sk            | attributes                         |
|-----------------------|---------------|------------------------------------|
| email#bob@example.com | email         | email: bob@example.com             |
|                       | password      | password: 09u32i1u....             |
|                       | note#iuohk... | title: my first note<br/>body: ... |
|                       | note#ldjad... | title: my 2nd note<br/>body: ...   |

The only real addition was the sort key (`'email' | 'password`) to User and
Password types.

Once these were added, I removed the three different tables and stored all
records in a single table.

I updated the queries to include the sort key (`pk = :pk and sk = :sk`, or for
notes, `pk = :pk and begins_with(sk, :sk)`).

## Add Todos

https://github.com/bennettp123/my-remix-app/pull/6

### Add a new model

* Todo
    ```ts
    pk: `email${string}`
    sk: `todo#${cuid}`
    title: string
    description: string
    isComplete: boolean
    ```

| pk                    | sk            | attributes                         |
|-----------------------|---------------|------------------------------------|
| email#bob@example.com | email         | email: bob@example.com             |
|                       | password      | password: 09u32i1u....             |
|                       | note#iuohk... | title: my first note<br/>body: ... |
|                       | note#ldjad... | title: my 2nd note<br/>body: ...   |
|                       | todo#9ukjd... | title: get out of bed<br/>description: ...<br/>isComplete: true |
|                       | todo#4sdku... | title: eat breakfast<br/>description: ...<br/>isComplete: false |
|                       | todo#4sdku... | title: brush teeth<br/>description: ...<br/>isComplete: false |

### Add routes

* `/todos` (outer): [app/routes/todos.tsx](app/routes/todos.tsx)
* `/todos` (inner): [app/routes/todos/index.tsx](app/routes/todos/index.tsx)
* `/todos/new`: [app/routes/todos/new.tsx](app/routes/todos/new.tsx)
* `/todos/:todoId`: [app/routes/todos/$todoId.tsx](app/routes/todos/$todoId.tsx)

These were mostly copy-pasted from the notes routes. However, I got a brief
overview of how the frontend components work with the data model. I also
needed to modify the form action in `/todos/:todoId` &mdash; for notes, the
only mutators are create and delete, but for todos, I wanted to add the
ability to mark them as complete.

This turned out to be pretty straightforward, even for someone with âœ¨limitedâœ¨
âœ¨frontendâœ¨ âœ¨skillsâœ¨

#### Remix Data Loaders

Data loaders run on the server, and fetch data from the model. 

In the route handler, `useLoaderData` is hydrated by the `loader` function.
The data returned is then available to use in your components:

```ts
import type { LoaderFunction } from '@remix-run/node'
import { json } from '@remix-run/node'
import { useLoaderData } from '@remix-run/react'
import invariant from 'tiny-invariant'

import type { Todo } from '~/models/todo.server'
import { getTodo } from '~/models/todo.server'
import { requireUserId } from '~/session.server'

export type LoaderData = {
    todo: Todo
}

export const loader: LoaderFunction = async ({ request, params }) => {
    const userId = await requireUserId(request)
    invariant(params.todoId, "todoId not found")

    const todo = await getTodo({ userId, id: params.todoId })

    if (!todo) {
        throw new Response("Not Found", { status: 404 })
    }
    return json<LoaderData>({ todo })
}

export default function TodoDetailsPage() {
    
    const data = useLoaderData() as LoaderData
    
    return (
        <div>
            <input
                style={{ display: "inline" }}
                type="checkbox"
                readonly={true}
                checked={data.todo.isCompleted} />
            
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold">
                {data.todo.title}
            </h3>
            
            <p className="py-6">
                {data.todo.description}
            </p>
        </div>
    )
}
```


#### Remix Mutators

In remix, mutations are performed using `<Form>` elements, which send
POST requests to the server as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` or
`multipart/form-data`. 

You can tell it which route to use when submitting the form, or let it use the
current route by default. Remix executes the `action` function in the route
handler.

To handle multiple forms, you need to include a hidden input, and then branch
conditionally in the `action` function:

```ts
import type { ActionFunction, LoaderFunction } from '@remix-run/node'
import { json, redirect } from '@remix-run/node'
import { Form, useCatch, useLoaderData, useSubmit, useTransition } from '@remix-run/react'
import invariant from 'tiny-invariant'

import type { Todo } from '~/models/todo.server'
import { setTodoCompletion } from '~/models/todo.server'
import { deleteTodo } from '~/models/todo.server'
import { getTodo } from '~/models/todo.server'
import { requireUserId } from '~/session.server'

export const loader: LoaderFunction = async ({ request, params }) => {
    const userId = await requireUserId(request)
    invariant(params.todoId, "todoId not found")

    const todo = await getTodo({ userId, id: params.todoId })

    if (!todo) {
        throw new Response("Not Found", { status: 404 })
    }
    return json<LoaderData>({ todo })
}

export const action: ActionFunction = async ({ request, params }) => {
    const userId = await requireUserId(request)
    invariant(params.todoId, "todoId not found")

    const formData = await request.formData()
    const _action = formData.get('_action')

    if (_action === 'update') {
        const isComplete = formData.getAll('state')?.includes('completed')
        await setTodoCompletion({ userId, id: params.todoId, isComplete })
        return redirect(`/todos/${params.todoId}`)
    }

    if (_action === 'delete') {
        await deleteTodo({ userId, id: params.todoId })
        return redirect("/todos")
    }

    throw new Error(`unhandled action: ${_action}`)
}

export default function TodoDetailsPage() {
    const data = useLoaderData() as LoaderData
    const submit = useSubmit()
    const transition = useTransition()

    function handleChanges(event: any) {
        submit(event.currentTarget, { replace: true })
    }

    return (
        <div>
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold">
                <Form
                    style={{ display: 'inline', paddingRight: '1em' }}
                    method="post"
                    onChange={handleChanges}
                >
                    <input
                        type="hidden"
                        name="_action"
                        value="update"
                    />

                    <input
                        type="checkbox"
                        name="state"
                        checked={data.todo.isComplete}
                        /**
                         * updated server-side, not client-side
                         */
                        readOnly={true}
                        /**
                         * this value is only included in formData when the
                         * checkbox is checked!
                         */
                        value="completed"
                    />
                </Form>
                {data.todo.title}
            </h3>
            <p className="py-6">{data.todo.description}</p>
            <hr className="my-4" />
            <Form method="post">

            </Form>
            { transition.state === 'submitting' ? (
                <p>Submitting...</p>
            ) : null }
            { transition.state === 'loading' ? (
                <p>Loading...</p>
            ) : null }
        </div>
    )
}
```
